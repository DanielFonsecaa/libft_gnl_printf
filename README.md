# libft_gnl_printf

A C library that combines [libft](https://github.com/DanielFonsecaa/libft_gnl_printf/tree/main/libft), [get_next_line](https://github.com/DanielFonsecaa/libft_gnl_printf/tree/main/gnl), and [printf](https://github.com/DanielFonsecaa/libft_gnl_printf/tree/main/printf) functionalities into a single, reusable package.  
This project is designed for use in C programming assignments and as a foundation for future C projects.

## Features

- **libft:** A collection of standard C library functions reimplemented from scratch (memory, string, list utilities, etc.).
- **get_next_line (gnl):** Efficient line-by-line file reading function.
- **printf:** Custom implementation of the standard `printf` function, supporting many format specifiers.
- Modular structure for easy integration and usage.
